# Small Dev Talk

Small Dev Talk is an independent news source that covers all things from the indie world of entertainment, from games to movies to books to technology and more. Our focus of Small Dev Talk is simply to give the chance of having upcoming developers show off their projects in forms of interviews which include images and video and present it to our audience.

## Getting Started

It is recommended that you use the web-version available at http://smalldevtalk.net/ but if you want to download and run the Small Dev Talk locally, it is possible though it requires an internet connection to load the images or any articles ([Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) was used as a hosting platform).
